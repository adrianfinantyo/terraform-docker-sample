## Overview

This repository serves as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution for deploying Docker containers. It offers a structured and version-controlled approach for managing your Docker images and containers using Terraform. The setup includes:

1. Dockerfile for building custom Docker images.
2. Terraform configuration for defining container resources and local development environments.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your local development machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- Any additional tools or dependencies required for your specific projects.

## Getting Started

### For Your Reference

You can check out the available Terraform-Docker config in this repository as a reference for your own projects.

### Genereate Your Own Terraform-Docker Config

You can also generate your own Terraform-Docker config by using the script provided in this repository. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Run the `tf-docker-template.sh` script in your terminal or you can also run it without cloning the repository by using the following command:

   ```bash
   sh  -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianfinantyo/terraform-docker-sample/main/scripts/tf-docker-template.sh)"
   ```

2. Adjust the generated Terraform-Docker config to fit your project requirements.

## Usage

- Modify the Dockerfile(s) in the `docker/` directory to build your custom Docker images.
- Define your Docker container resources in the `main.tf` file using the `docker_container` resource.
- Use variables and modules as needed for project-specific configurations.
- Run `terraform apply` to create or manage your Docker containers.

**Note**: For production deployments, customize your Terraform configuration to work with your chosen IaaS provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and set up remote state storage.
